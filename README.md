## Description 

We were asked to develop an application that can be run through terminal/command line to create a professional README.md. 

## Usage 
1. Navigate to the directory titled Develop, within the downloaded repository. 
2. Run ~$ node index.js
3. Answer the following prompts in your cmdline/terminal
4. The README.md will appear in Main/fin

## User Story
AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
WHEN I enter my project title
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
WHEN I enter my GitHub username
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
WHEN I enter my email address
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README


## Learning Points 

The purpose of this challenge was to grant us with the opportunity to practice writing code in javascript. To be more specific, we were encouraged to develop an application through the use of node packages, fs and inquire, as well a few scripts of our own. We were asked to make these scripts accessible by saving them as module.exports, which we then imported in our index and used to successfully generate a professional README.md within the directory titled Develop.
